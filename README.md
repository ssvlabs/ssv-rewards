# ssv-rewards

Synchronizes historical activity and performance of SSV validators and calculates their rewards according to [Incentivized Mainnet Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcr8QVcq9eZfiOJGrm5OsE9JAqdQy1F8Svv1xgecjNY).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-rewards
cd ssv-rewards
cp .env.example .env
cp rewards.example.yaml rewards.yaml
```

Edit `.env` and fill in the required values:

```ini
# SSV network
NETWORK=mainnet

# Beacon API endpoint of the consensus node
CONSENSUS_ENDPOINT=http://beacon-node:5052

# JSON-RPC API endpoint of the execution node
EXECUTION_ENDPOINT=http://excution-node:8545

# SSV API endpoint
SSV_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.ssv.network/api/v4

# Beaconcha.in API
BEACONCHA_ENDPOINT=https://beaconcha.in
BEACONCHA_API_KEY= # Optional
BEACONCHA_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=20 # Adjust according to your Beaconcha.in API plan
```

Edit `rewards.yaml` to match [the specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcr8QVcq9eZfiOJGrm5OsE9JAqdQy1F8Svv1xgecjNY):

    # Alternatively, you can specify redirects using external CSV files:
    # - You cannot use both `owner_redirects` and `owner_redirects_file` simultaneously. Choose one method.
    # - You cannot use both `validator_redirects` and `validator_redirects_file` simultaneously. Choose one method.
    # - Each file must have a header row with "from" and "to" as column names.

    # For owner redirects, the "from" column contains owner addresses, and the "to" column contains recipient addresses.
    # Example of owner_redirects_file content:
    # from,to
    # 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678,0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef

    # If set to true, the reward calculation will use the actual effective balance (end_effective_balance)
    # for active and registered effective balance calculations.
     # If omitted or set to false, the legacy behavior will apply, using a fixed value of 32 ETH
     # This should be enabled for compatibility with Ethereum's Pectra upgrade.
    pectra_support: false # Use real effective balance instead of fixed 32 ETH

    # network_fee_address (optional) is the address that will collect all network fees deducted from rewards.
    # When specified, a new entry will be added to reward CSVs showing the total collected fees for this address.
    # These fee deductions are then included in the merkle tree as rewards for the network fee address.
    network_fee_address: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"


rounds:
  - period: 2023-07 # Designated period (year-month)
    eth_apr: 0.047 # ETH Staking APR
    ssv_eth: 0.0088235294 # SSV/ETH price

    # `network_fee` (optional) is the network fee in Gwei (1 SSV = 1e9 Gwei)
    # that will be proportionally deducted from rewards for the round.
    # Example: To specify a fee of 0.1 SSV, use 100_000_000 (0.1 * 1e9) Gwei.
    # If omitted, no fee deduction is applied.
    network_fee: 100_000_000  # Network fee in SSV Gwei
  # ...
```

## Usage

First, start PostgreSQL and wait a few seconds for it to be ready:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

### Synchronization

Synchronize validator activity and performance:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm sync
```

_This should sync validator performance up until 2 days ago (UTC) or until the end of the last period in `rewards.yaml` (whichever is lower). Therefore, in order to sync the last month, waiting until the 3rd of this month is required._

_This might take a while, depending on how long ago the SSV contract was deployed and how many validators there are._

### Faster Sync & Lower API Usage

All data fetched from **Beaconcha.in** (validator stats) and the **SSV API** (decided data) is automatically cached in:
```
<data-dir>/<network>/.cache
```
This caching improves performance, reduces sync time, and helps prevent hitting API rate limits.

‚ö†Ô∏è By default, this cache is **deleted** when running with `--fresh` or `--fresh-ssv`.
To preserve the `.cache` directory during a fresh sync, use the `--keep-cache` flag:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm sync sync --fresh --keep-cache
```

### Calculation

After syncing, you may calculate the reward distribution:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm calc
```

This produces the following documents under the `./rewards` directory:

```bash
üìÇ rewards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-owner.csv            # Reward for each owner for each round
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-validator.csv        # Reward for each validator for each round
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-recipient.csv        # Reward for each recipient for each round
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ total-by-owner.csv      # Total reward for each owner
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ total-by-validator.csv  # Total reward for each validator
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ <year>-<month>
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-owner.csv        # Total reward for each owner for that round
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-validator.csv    # Total reward for each validator for that round
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ by-recipient.csv    # Total reward for each recipient for that round
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ cumulative.json     # Cumulative reward for each owner until and including that round
```

- `recipient` is the address that eventually receives the reward, which is either the owner address, or if the owner is redirecting the reward, the address specified in `owner_redirects` or `owner_redirects_file`.

### Merkleization

After calculating the reward distribution, you may merkleize the rewards for a specific round.

1. Copy the file at `./rewards/<year>-<month>/cumulative.json` over to `./scripts/merkle-generator/scripts/input_1.json`.
2. Run the merkleization script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/merkle-generator
   npm i
   npx hardhat run scripts/merkle.ts
   ```
3. The merkle tree is generated at `./merkle-generator/scripts/output-1.json`.

## Updating

1. Pull the changes and rebuild the Docker images:
   ```bash
   git pull
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Refer to `.env.example` and update your `.env` file if necessary.
3. Refer to `rewards.example.yaml` and update your `rewards.yaml` file if necessary.
4. Sync with `--fresh` to re-create the databases and sync from scratch:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm sync sync --fresh
   ```
